# RC7

It was one of the most famous exploit back in ~2014-2016, then died and later came back, but again died because of sentinel devs.

# Elysian
Elysian was a very reputable and long lasting exploit. 
It was initially created in 2015 as an unrestricted executor and has from then survived until ~2021. 
Swift and effective (efficient, too, using a slightly more efficient method of execution) execution with a side panel that allowed you to easily run and peek at scripts, founding that whole script-list innovation. 
It was arguably the most effective executor on the market upon its release and maintenance, however, the release of newer and more revolutionary software has made it a less jubilant product and more of an icon on the forum's history - being the longest lasting exploit on v3rmillion. Consider yourself lucky if you managed to get your hands on a copy of Elysian as a new v3rmillion user.

# Stigma
Stigma was an exploit with an internal ui made originaly by momof513. You had to inject the dll with any dll injector.
It is very old, around 2014, and the interface was simple yet very cool.
The ui was so cool, that the private serverside "projec ligma" is based off stigma's ui
